## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Code-wise, the only thing I learned was that using padding on an element makes its border-radius act strange. margin did what I wanted without breaking the border-radius.

The real learning I had was the experience. It's the first challenge I made in english and that's not from a course I was doing. It is also the first project I actually write a readme and use a bit of Markdown.
